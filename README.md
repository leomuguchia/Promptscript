### 1.1 Motivation
PromptScript is an open source DSL and AI orchestration platform that converts high-level developer intents into executable code. Leveraging modern AI language models and a structured prompt engineering approach, PromptScript aims to:

- **Reduce the barrier to coding:** Let non-experts describe functionality in a semi-structured format.
- **Accelerate prototyping:** Rapidly convert ideas into runnable code.
- **Unify human intent and machine execution:** Create a consistent workflow from ideation to deployment.

### 1.2 Scope
This document outlines the technical design of PromptScript, focusing on:
- DSL syntax and structure
- Context management and multi-step reasoning
- AI orchestration and code generation pipeline
- Integration with deployment workflows

3. **Intent Translator:**
   - Converts DSL blocks into structured AI prompts.
   - Uses chain-of-thought techniques to ensure multi-step reasoning.
   - Responsible for context augmentation: embedding blueprint details and dependencies.

4. **AI Compiler/Orchestrator:**
   - **AI Query Executor:** Connects to language models (via APIs like OpenAI’s GPT-4) to generate code.
   - **Session Context Manager:** Maintains state and passes global/local context between queries.
   - **Meta-Prompter:** Monitors responses for consistency, re-prompts if necessary.

5. **Code Aggregator:**
   - **Stitching Engine:** Combines generated code fragments into a cohesive codebase.
   - **Dependency Resolver:** Ensures data models, API endpoints, and module references are correctly linked.
   - **Formatter & Linter:** Integrates with tools like Black, Prettier, or ESLint for code quality.

6. **Deployment Manager:**
   - Provides containerization (Docker support) and integration with cloud providers (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS, Firebase).
   - Automates build, test, and deploy processes via CI/CD pipelines.

 -**NB:** This isn’t just about code generation—it’s about preserving the context (blueprint details, workflows, task dependencies) to generate coherent, integrated solutions.

## 3. Detailed Component Specifications

### 3.1 DSL Parser & Context Builder

#### 3.1.1 DSL Syntax Overview

A sample PromptScript snippet:
```promptscript
blueprint ToDoApp {
    version: "1.0"
    author: "LeoMuguchia"
    goal: "Develop a full-stack to-do app with user authentication, task management, and dynamic UI."
}

prompt UserAuth {
    define Data:
        User { email: string, password: string, verified: bool }
    
    task register:
        input: User user
        instruction: "Store user data securely and send a verification email."
        output: "registrationStatus"
    
    task login:
        input: email: string, password: string
        instruction: "Authenticate the user and generate a session token."
        output: "sessionToken"
}

workflow ToDoFlow {
    step auth -> UserAuth.login(email, password)
    step addTask -> TaskManager.create(title)
}
```

## 3.1.2 Parser Implementation
Language: Python 3.x

Parsing Technique:

Use regular expressions for a proof-of-concept.
Later iterations may leverage parser generators (e.g., ANTLR) for robustness.
Output Data Structure:
The parser produces a JSON-like context tree:

```json
{
    "blueprint": {
        "name": "ToDoApp",
        "properties": {
            "version": "1.0",
            "author": "leomuguchia",
            "goal": "Develop a full-stack to-do app..."
        }
    },
    "prompts": [
        {
            "name": "UserAuth",
            "tasks": [
                {
                    "name": "register",
                    "input": "User user",
                    "instruction": "Store user data securely...",
                    "output": "registrationStatus"
                },
                {
                    "name": "login",
                    "input": "email: string, password: string",
                    "instruction": "Authenticate the user...",
                    "output": "sessionToken"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "workflow": {
        "name": "ToDoFlow",
        "steps": [
            "UserAuth.login(email, password)",
            "TaskManager.create(title)"
        ]
    }
}
```

## 3.2 Intent Translator & AI Compiler
## 3.2.1 Intent Translation
Function: Transform DSL blocks into AI-friendly prompt strings.

Chain-of-Thought Example:
For the task UserAuth.login, the generated prompt might be:
```
"You are an AI developer tasked with generating a Python Flask endpoint. 
The function should accept JSON with an 'email' and 'password', authenticate the user,
and return a session token. Please include proper error handling and follow secure coding practices."
```
Context Augmentation:
Combine global blueprint details (e.g., app version, architectural stack) with local prompt data.

## 3.2.2 AI Compiler/Orchestrator
Technology:
Python-based microservice that interacts with external AI APIs.

## Modules:
### Session Context Manager:
Manages conversation state, using caching (e.g., Redis) for persistent context across API calls.

### Query Executor:
Assembles prompts and sends them to AI services (using asynchronous calls for speed).
### Meta-Prompter:
Evaluates responses for consistency, triggers additional prompts if the code fragment misses key elements.
### API Integration:
Use REST/GraphQL interfaces to communicate with AI platforms.
Secure API keys and use rate limiting to handle multiple requests.

# 3.3 Code Aggregator & Deployment Manager
## 3.3.1 Code Aggregator
### Stitching Engine:
Combines multiple language fragments (e.g., backend code in Python, frontend in JavaScript) into a coherent project structure.
### Dependency Resolver:
Utilizes a mapping of symbols (classes, functions) across modules to ensure inter-dependencies are met.
Formatting:
Hooks into linters/formatters to standardize code style.

# 3.3.2 Deployment Manager
## Containerization:
Generates Dockerfiles and Kubernetes YAML configurations.
## CI/CD Integration:
Provides scripts to integrate with platforms like GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated testing and deployment.
## Cloud Connectors:
Configurations for deploying to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google Cloud Run).

# 4. Context Management & Reasoning Strategies
## 4.1 Hierarchical Context Tree
 - Global Context:
Stored in a central JSON file, includes blueprint details.
 - Local Context:
Each prompt/task node includes inherited context from its parent.

## 4.2 Dynamic Context Window Optimization
- Summarization:
Use summarization APIs to condense long contexts when token limits are reached.
- Pinning Critical Data:
Always include blueprint metadata and primary module dependencies in every prompt.

## 4.3 Multi-Agent Reasoning (Future Work)
Agent Roles:

**Architect Agent:** Plans overall project structure.
**Coder Agent:** Generates code for individual tasks.
**Reviewer Agent:** Analyzes and refines generated code.
**Deployment Agent:** Packages and deploys the final output.
**Coordination:** Agents share a unified context tree and communicate through internal APIs.

# 5. Implementation Roadmap
## Phase 1: Prototype Development
Build a minimal parser and context builder.
Create a simple web-based editor (using React or similar).

# 6. Viability & Impact
 ### Bridging the Gap: 
 The idea of translating high-level, human-friendly prompts into executable code directly tackles the challenge of lowering the barrier to entry for coding. This could empower non-developers to prototype and even deploy applications, effectively democratizing software development.

### Accelerated Development:
 By abstracting away boilerplate and even some of the logic implementation, PromptScript could drastically speed up prototyping. It provides a structured framework that leverages AI to generate context-aware code fragments.

### Alignment with Industry Trends:
 With leaders in the AI field predicting a future where natural language interfaces drive code generation (as referenced by Jensen Huang’s vision), this project is right on the pulse of where technology is headed.

## Challenges to Consider: 
While promising, there are challenges:
### Reliability and Robustness:
 Generated code needs to be secure, maintainable, and correctly integrated.
### Context Management: 
 Ensuring that the AI understands and retains long-term context (especially for larger projects) is non-trivial.
# Developer Adoption:
 Developers might be skeptical until the tool proves its worth in real-world scenarios.
